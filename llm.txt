# PROJECT: ARROW PUZZLE
# CATEGORY: MINIMALIST LOGIC GAME

## CORE ARCHITECTURE RULES
- STACK: React (v19+), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.
- STATE: Strictly functional components with React Hooks.
- GRID: Fixed 6x6 coordinate system (FIXED_GRID_SIZE = 6).
- ASSETS: Zero external assets. Use SVG/CSS for all UI/UX elements.

## GAMEPLAY STRATEGY & LOGIC PROTECTION
- MOVEMENT: Blocks move in a straight line (Direction). They MUST fly off the grid to be removed.
- COLLISION: Any path intersection with an existing block triggers a collision (Life loss).
- SOLVABILITY: All levels MUST be procedurally generated using the "Reverse Solving" strategy found in geminiService.ts.
- REVERSE SOLVER: Levels are generated by placing blocks that *can* exit the current grid state, ensuring at least one solution exists.
- SEEDING: Deterministic level generation using level number + difficulty + seedModifier.

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (LOGO: DEEJAY LABS)
- BRANDING: Premium 3D aesthetic. Horizontal alignment for the logo (Icon + Text side-by-side).
- ANIMATION: Use "fly-out" transforms with motion blur effects for block exits. 
- FEEDBACK: Collision alerts MUST be high-contrast (Red) and use haptic-inspired UI shakes.

## AI GUARDRAILS
- DO NOT remove the procedural generator logic in favor of static level lists.
- DO NOT modify GRID_SIZE without updating targetBlockCount scaling in geminiService.ts.
- MAINTAIN the deterministic seeding logic to ensure users across different devices see the same levels.
- PROTECT the minimalist UI by avoiding cluttered menus; prioritize the 9:16 aspect ratio (Mobile-First).
